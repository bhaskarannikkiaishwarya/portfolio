			<h2>Welcome</h2>
			<p>
				My name is Nikki, a Product Designer based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu—where mornings begin with the smell of coffee. With over six years’ experience, I’ve worn many hats: entrepreneur, strategist, product manager and designer. I’ve worked with teams at Programming.com (Samsung), RAPID, Hexaware and more. I’m a confident generalist across product design, product strategy, incubation, visual design and design systems, and I thrive in interdisciplinary settings where I can collaborate, ideate and ship.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I’m not solving user problems, you’ll find me reading historical non-fiction, crafting melodies in my home studio, cooking up a storm and travelling to broaden my perspective. I also love organising homes and have a soft spot for candle-making. Welcome to my site—feel free to have a look around.

			<h2>Headwinds & tailwinds</h2>

				Below is a curated collection of laws, principles, and concepts that I often reference when tackling a problem. They are all somewhat inevitable aspect of our professional and personal lives, and they always present a choice. We can view them as either headwinds that challenge us, or tailwinds that propel us forward.

					<h3>Dunbar's Number</h3>

						Dunbar's Number puts a cap on how many stable relationships you can comfortably maintain and manage: about 150. It's a sweet spot for ensuring quality personal connections and a fascinating insight into the evolution of the human brain.

					<h3>Chesterton's Fence</h3>
